I tried to extend the plugin with some features like:
- :-1: auto-expand fold on error
- :+1: decrease fold elements to save space
- :+1: add section footer to close sections within rounded boxes
- :-1: extend regexp matching to indicate failures, errors, section names, fold depth
- :-1: allow section end to specify section ID (or name) to avoid wrong fold being closed
